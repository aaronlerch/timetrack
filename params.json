{"name":"Time Track","tagline":"because knowing how much you work is important","body":"Time Tracker is a small one-user application to help you track your time. I use it to keep track of my hours at work. I was doing this with a spreadsheet, but decided something a little more automated would be nice. Time Tracker is built with Ruby and Sinatra and can be deployed to Heroku without any modifications. Just set the necessary environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### Config File\r\nSet your local timezone in `./config/config.yml`. The default is set to Eastern Time.\r\n\r\n### Environment Variables\r\nThere are three environment variables you need to set `G_API_CLIENT`, `G_API_SECRET`, and `VALID_EMAIL`.\r\n\r\n* `G_API_CLIENT` - Google API Client ID\r\n* `G_API_SECRET` - Google API Client Secret\r\n* `VALID_EMAIL` - A string of e-mail addresses that can use the application\r\n\r\nTo get your Google API client id and secret you will need to use the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[![Creative Commons License](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US)\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US).
